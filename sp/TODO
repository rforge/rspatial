meuse$xx = meuse$zinc - mean(meuse$zinc) # does not do what you want

add methods:
mean.SpatialDataFrame
mean.SpatialDataFrameGrid
mean.SpatialDataFramePolygon ...

add "[[" and "[[<-" to Spatial methods ( meuse$xx == meuse[["xx"]] )

For plotting functions (plot, bubble) use a reasonable x/y ratio for
unprojected data (look in maps?), or bail out with an error

First cut at getting holes and polygon order right, Polygon4 and Polylist4
classes for trial.

build simple SpatialDataFramePolygons example, e.g. using two triangles
add subscripting [] to SpatialDataFramePolygon objects (with much care!)

find out why does, in S-Plus, 
  for(i in 1:100) { polygon(P4x@polygons[[i]]@coords) }
work, but does plot(P4x) error?

Do we need to set a method here?

clean up this file

add CHANGES file to SF


SpatialDataPolygons doesn't known which columns in the
attribute data are the label points. Changed into
SpatialDataFramePolygon, descending from
SpatialDataFrame.

plot.SpatialDataFrameGrid does not do much useful: use levelplot?

Remove all PolygonX classes extending SpatialData; 
however, does each polygon need a bounding box? On reflection, 
no great overhead, and they do need bboxes.

subsetting polygons;
not replicate projection in polygons;
(plotting) polygons with islands; crossing polygons?
SpatialDataPolygons -> SpatialDataFramePolygons

What exactly is the interface?
1 coordinates() gets/sets coordinates
2 [Pp]olygons() gets/sets polygons
3 as.data.frame() gets the data as data.frame

0.4-1 splits proj out of sp and (hopefully) simplifies 20030318 RSB

ToDo S-Plus:
plotting polygons doesn't work yet

do we need "[<-" ?

look at stack() to improve map.to.lev

write article for R-NEWS

draft specification of interfaces:

bbox
coordinates
coordinates<- # 2/3D matrix, char vector, int vector, formula; allow NULL object
polygons
polygons<-

methods for _all_ (?) classes:
	print/show
	plot
	summary
	as.data.frame

manuals:
	SpatialData generic functions
	SpatialDataFrame functions
	SpatialDataFrameGrid functions
	SpatialDataPolygons functions

done: maps -> SpatialDataPolygons; do reverse?
	as(x, "maps") # for SpatialDataPolygons
	look at difference in range between maps() and those of polygon vertexes

test:
	3D data frames
	3D regular grids
	3D: test as.images.SDFG for (x,y), (x,z) and (y,z) slices

S-PLUS portability:
	PACKAGE = ...
	plot(..., asp = 1)

DONE:
-----
make "[" work for SDFGrid and SDPolygons
