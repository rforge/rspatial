<h1>Downloading sp and related projects</h1>

There are two methods for obtaining sp or related projects:
<ul>
<li>Packages should be obtained from CRAN (by using install.packages(), or through the GUI menu: install packages from CRAN); this is the preferred way, but if you need as yet unreleased functionality, please download or install directly from <a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1014">R-forge</a>.
</li>
</ul>
